# Emuloader


**Emuloader is now available on GitHub!**    

***Introduction:***

It's done. No more megathread, no more looks through mega or clicking through adfly links or trying to find the right download button or sifting through malware infested websites. No more download limits, speed caps, broken roms, password protected zips and rars. No more manually updating your emulators every week and moving installs about hoping for nothing to break. No more weird download managers to get things off zippyshare or weird names with 12 different groups and urls in your rom name that you have to manually sift through. No more mixing up regions because you can't tell if (U) means universal or USA. No more looking for boxart sets and carefully cropping and naming each image or searching for missing images because your set was incomplete!

**It's like /r/roms, /r/emulation, itunes, steam and google drive all mixed into one.
6 months on and I've (mostly) finished what I set out to do.**

An all-in-one client that finds, downloads, and plays your backed up games, always with the newest versions of emulators. With some cloud sync magic thrown in! It's got a library manager like itunes, automatic updating, set-up, cloud backups and restores likes steam. **And it's all open source.**

It will have one click sharing of games saves or homebrew roms with your friends, automatic streaming of local multiplayer games. One-click to join the lobbies of your friends in different emulators through one unified interface.

***Features***

The featurelist includes:

* Sorting of games by region, platform and source.
* Supports 17 Platforms via 14 emulators.
* Download manager allows downloading of many backups (that you legally own) at once with no captchas.
* Allows the queuing of thousands of downloads at once, automatically sorting them as it goes.
* Automatically finds boxart for downloaded games on a per platform or per game basis.
* Shows verbose network usage statistics and supports download acceleration.
* Supports importing of existing titles.
* Automatically updates emulators so ensure you always have the latest performance improvements and bugfixes.
* Highly customisable theming and banner art.
* Prettifies file names automagically giving your collections a clean look.
* Offline mode lets Emuloader function without internet acess, tungsten services or external updates and services.
* Data hoarder mode allows emuloader to play games stored in .zip,  .rar and ,7z archives, saving large amounts of disk space. (Suggested by SuperBio!)
* Buy physical copies/soundtracks directly within emuloader, supporting google shopping, Amazon, ebay and more.
* Dropbox integration.
* Automatically syncs and backs up saves, games and configurations after every session, easily enabled and disabled in settings.
* Sorts roms into folders by platform.
* Wiki with documentation to help with any confusion.
* Modern and simple UI design.

When I started, all I knew was I've seen on discords and even on this subreddit how annoying and frustrating it is when trying to grab your backups off the web and fiddling with which emulator to use and getting boxart and the whole experience and figured that there had to be a better way, kind of like steam where you open the client and its got all your games listed ready to download, with the emulators just as easy to set-up with one click to download and play, but it's become so much more.

***Rom sources & .eldrs + Legal stuff:***

Obviously I cannot have links to roms hardcoded in and for this I have designed a new way for backups to be shared easily (between yourself and yourself only as we all know sharing roms is piracy and I don't endorse it, but hauling upto hundreds of gigs of backups wherever you go is also stupid) called .eldrs.

.eldrs/sources are files which are basically lists of encoded games, their sizes and the downloads. You import these sources by simply dragging and dropping or importing directly from a link (such as a raw pastebin). and the client is instantly populated! It's built for use with your already existing cloud services, primarily dropbox which it has native support for.

I can't bundle eldrs with the client for obvious reasons but it will help you find some during first time setup, and there's the guide for you to make your own up on the subreddit.

Obvious disclaimer that you shouldn't use it to make your pirating life easier, only use the roms you've legally dumped yourself and don't go around posting .eldrs on the open web. More information on https://tungstencore.com/emuloader/#Disclaimer

Fortunately I've had some patrons totalling about $10 a month at peak to help me develop but honestly if I were to continue development and afford finishing off the featureset I do require your help! Please donate to my patreon to help me continue development (Found on the website) and to get extra perks. Also join the discord to be a part of the community and get updates and sources first!

***False positives and Open source info:***

Although I submitted the app to avast, bitdefender and a few others a few months ago, the codebase had changed significantly and might be detected as a false positive. I know avast reports is because it says the app is rarely used (which of course it is I'm only releasing it to the public now!)

Nevertheless, rest assured that the client code is visible on github, and the python modules were compiled using pyinstaller and so can also be easily decompiled and viewed.

***Patreon and supporting development:***

If you've liked the work I've done, and want to help me make it better, round out the features and [start adding new ones](https://imgur.com/a/TBaivLW) I'd really appreciate throwing a few dollars my way on Patreon or ko-fi. I can't keep up regular work on this with 5$ a month (although I appreciate it very much!). You don't have to, but it'll help *and* comes with some extra perks!
