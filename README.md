# Emuloader


‘Steam for Emulation’ is what Emuloader is. Typically when playing emulated games it’s a pain to find an up-to-date version of an emulator, and when you do finding games to play is even more frustrating, especially if your backups are coming from the cloud where they may not even be safe to run. It’s more than a front-end.

Emuloader fixes both these problems, by providing

    One click installs of popular emulation software.
    A single interface to download backups (that you legally own)

It allows you to skip the entire ‘going through dodgy websites straight out of 1995’ phase, handling everything in the background, doing so while being open source.

Since Emuloader has its own download manager and sorting system, nothing is left to the end-user to do except import source lists (via .eldr files or directly from online such as pastebin.) and even that is guided through by the app.

Full feature list:

    Sorting of games by region, and platform.
    Supports PSP, N64, GBA, GBC, WIIU, WII, DS, 3DS, Dreamcast, Genesis and more!
    Download manager allows downloading of many backups (that you legally own) at once with no captchas.

    Supports importing of existing titles.
    Up-to-date versions of emulators, no need to source them yourself.
    Prettifies file names.
    Sorts roms into folders by platform.
    Modern and simple UI design.
